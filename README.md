# üß¨ PyScript Bioinformatics Tool

We were get used to write HTML in Python while using `Flask`, `Django` or other web frameworks like `Dash`.
Now, how about writing Python in HTML? Yep, you heard right :) Thanks to PyScript!

## #Ô∏è‚É£ What is [`PyScript`](https://pyscript.net/)?

**TL;DR:** It enables you to run Python in HTML!

> **Offically:** PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML‚Äôs interface. PyScript aims to give users a first-class programming language that has consistent styling rules, is more expressive, and is easier to learn.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ What's the functionality here?

In this small repository, I aimed to build an example helps first-comers to `PyScript` while dealing with the user inputs and also to welcome the bioinformatics / computational biology communities for their next applications with `PyScript`!

Here, I inspired by [a single-page web tool](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html) that handles a common DNA sequence utility (getting `reverse`, `complement`, `reverse-complement` counterparts of a given DNA sequence).

Basically, it enables any researcher to play around with DNA sequence and get the desired output according to their goals.
